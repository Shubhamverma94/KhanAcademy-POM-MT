- Node.js in the [semantic version range](https://semver.org) `^14.17.0 || ^16.13.0 || >=18.0.0`
- Python v3+ if building HTML documentation

## Running for Main Appium Docs

This package does not need to be run directly. Instead, execute this command in the `packages/appium` folder of [this monorepo](https://github.com/appium/appium):

```bash
npm run dev:docs:en
````

See the `scripts` field of the `package.json` for other languages.

## Using in Appium Extensions

TODO: give an example of how this package is used in an extension outside the appium monorepo, for example when it's made a part of the XCUITest repo. Or link to the part of the Appium docs where this info will live.
